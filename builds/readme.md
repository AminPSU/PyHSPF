Binary and source distributions have moved to the Python Package Index below to avoid cluttering GitHub with binary files.

These builds are provided for convenience. If you need a build for an alternative platform (Mac OS, Linux, 32-bit, etc.) that is not available, then please send a request. Please report any issues with the installation or testing. Note that the examples distributed with the source are designed for the latest distribution and therefore may not work correctly with older distributions.

These builds are provided for convenience. Some issues have been reported for Windows 
related to dependencies on three DLLs from the GNU compilers specific to the platform 
including gfortran, gcc, and quadmath. Please report any issues with the installation or testing. Also note that the examples may not work correctly with older builds.

Binary and source distributions will be uploaded to PyPi in the future in hopes of focusing this page on development and not to clutter github with binary files.

The examples provided in this folder illustrate how to use PyHSPF and the associated utilities. The examples are organized into several categories to illustrate different concepts needed to use HSPF and how PyHSPF can help accomplish these tasks. Here is a summary of the files and the concepts illustrated in the file. 

Introduction -- These examples are designed to illustrate how HSPF organizes information about the world into a computer program and how PyHSPF can be used to interact with HSPF. I would suggest going through these first to understand how HSPF works and how to use Python to supply the necessary information to HSPF. The other sections illustrate how to use some data tools to get the information into Python that is supplied directly in these scripts.

Tests -- These scripts were developed to run the test simulations distributed with the HSPF source code. They use data in the files located in the "data/calibrated" directory, and make output files there. These scripts may be of interest to people who are already familiar with HSPF or to people who want a deeper understanding of how PyHSPF interacts with the HSPF library. Information from the real world must be translated into the User Control Input (UCI) and Watershed Data Management (WDM) files to perform HSPF simulations. Existing UCI files could be adapted and run in Python using the approaches outlines in these examples. 

GIS data examples -- Python has many modules that are useful for working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data. HSPF models require hydrography data such as average slope within a basin, average elevation in a basin, elevations at the reach inlet and outlet, latitudes, longitudes, etc. HSPF modeling typically employs land use data to subdivide basins into hydrologically-similar units (PERLNDs). PyHSPF integrates built-in Python modules with extension modules (PyShp and GDAL) to extract data from a few particularly useful publically-available data sets including the National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2 (NHDPlus), the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), and the National Inventory of Dams (NID). These tools can expedite extraction and integration of data in new watersheds into HSPF models in the United States. It's worth noting that similar tools could be developed for many other datasets such as hydrography in other countries or landuse datasets with different categories/emphasis. 

Time series extraction -- HSPF is centered around manipulations of time series, and thus it is necessary to supply many external time series to use HSPF. PyHSPF has utilities to gather all the necessary time series data together from several publically-available databases. The National Water Information System (NWIS) contains flow and water quality time series data. The Global Historical Climate Network Daily (GHCND) contains many climate time series including min and max temperature, snowfall, snowdepth, wind speed, and pan evaporation. The Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) data contains min and max temperature, dew point, and wind speed. The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) has hourly estimates of solar radiation based on several models in addition to a limited amount of observed solar radiation data. The hourly precipitation database (3240) from the National Climate Data Center contains data from stations with hourly observations. Given the extreme spatial and temporal variability and the obvious importance of precipitation for hydrologic modeling, this is a particularly important dataset. 

Time Series Processing -- The raw time series data gathered from the various databases are typically not suitable for hydrologic modeling for a variety of reasons. For example, some of the data may be missing or errors may have been made in reporting. HSPF models require estimates of the conditions throughout the watershed, so "point" observations must be interpolated/extrapolated throughout the watershed. There are an infinite number of different possibilities for aggregating and disaggregating the time series data. PyHSPF has a ClimateProcessor class to assist with these tasks. 

Special Actions -- This section needs work, but there is one example. Special Actions are designed to represent how the activities of humans modify hydrological processes in HSPF. Some examples of this include tilling, harvesting, pesticide and fertilizer applications.

Advanced -- The scripts in this directory illustrate how to integrate together the data into more complicated models. This section needs work.

Suggestions and questions are always welcome. Note that these examples may not be compatible with older versions of the software. Please report any problems running the scripts in these directories (make sure you have the data files in the right location first).

The examples provided in this folder illustrate how to use PyHSPF to work with HSPF "Special Actions." This section (and the software) needs work, but there is one example. Special Actions are designed to represent how the activities of humans modify hydrological processes in HSPF. Some examples of this include tilling, harvesting, pesticide and fertilizer applications.

- **specialactions01.py:** similar to intro01.py but illustrates the use of "Special Actions"

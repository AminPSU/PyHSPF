PyHSPF is in need of further development. The following are specific features that need to be added. Contact the developers if you have other suggestions or are interested in contributing to development/extension of these or other applications.

1. Examples of snow simulations and time series integration
2. Examples of sediment transport simulations
3. Examples of Upper Mississippi HydrologyCalibrator application
4. More Special Actions added to existing functions
5. Addition of HSPF temperature modules
6. Addition of utility modules to improve memory allocation (HSPF COPY module)
7. Addition of other HSPF quality modules for the HSPFModel and associated classes
8. Additional HSPF nitrogen, phosphorous, and pesticide modules
9. Integration with other watershed delineation tools (e.g., TauDEM)
10. Variable land use with time
11. Open Source GIS Integration
12. Pandas integration for time series management
13. Data-based FTABLE development
14. NCDC 15-minute precipitation database/15-minute time step
